Step 1: Create a new Rasa project

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Rasa project.
Run the following command to create a new Rasa project: rasa init --no-prompt
This will create a basic Rasa project structure with some default files.


Step 2: Define your intents and entities


Step 3: Collect user conversation history

Modify the endpoints.yml file to enable the event broker. Add the following configuration under the event_broker section:
Start the Rasa server by running the following command: rasa run --enable-api --cors "*"

Collect user conversation history by sending messages to the Rasa server using API calls. For example, you can use Python's requests library:


Generate an NLU file from conversation history

Create a Python script to process the conversation history and generate an NLU file


Step 4: Train your Rasa model with the generated NLU file

Copy the generated NLU file (generated_nlu.yml) to the data/nlu.yml file in your Rasa project.
Run the following command to train your Rasa model: rasa train
Step 5: Test your trained Rasa bot

Start the Rasa server by running the following command: rasa run --enable-api --cors "*"
Interact with the Rasa bot by sending messages to the server using API calls.
By following these steps, you can collect the user conversation history, generate an NLU file based on that history, and use it to train your Rasa bot. This approach allows your bot to learn from real user interactions and improve its understanding of intents and entities.
